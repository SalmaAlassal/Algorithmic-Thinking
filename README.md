# Algorithm Notes

Welcome to my algorithm notes repo! This is a collection of notes that I've taken while studying various algorithms. I've created this repo to keep my notes organized and easily accessible, and I hope that it can be a useful resource for others who are also studying algorithms.

# Contents

The notes in this repository are organized by algorithm type, with each type of algorithm having its own folder. Within each folder, you'll find notes on specific algorithms, along with any relevant code examples, diagrams, or other resources that I've found helpful.

# Contributing

While this repo is primarily for my own personal use, I welcome contributions from anyone who would like to help improve the notes or add additional resources. 

If you'd like to contribute, please feel free to submit a pull request. If you're not sure how to do that, you can also just open an issue, and I'll try to get to it as soon as I can.
